1. Using Immutable Data Structures

 - Data immutability is not an architecture or design pattern, it’s an opinionated way of writing code. This forces you to think about how you structure your application data flow. In my opinion, data immutability is a practice that revolves around a strict unidirectional data flow.

 -  React state should be treated as immutable. We should never mutate this.state directly, as calling setState() afterward may replace the mutation you made.

 - So what’s wrong with mutating state directly? Let’s say we overwrite shouldComponentUpdate and are checking nextState against this.state to make sure that we only re-render components when changes happen in the state.

 ```
 shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    if (this.state.users !== nextState.users) {
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
 ```
 - React setState method is asynchronous. This means that rather than immediately mutating this.state, setState() creates a pending state transition. If you access this.state after calling this method, it would potentially return the existing value. To prevent this, use the callback function of setState to run code after the call is completed.
