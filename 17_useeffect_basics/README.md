## useState Hook
- [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) documentation.
- useState is a Hook. We call it inside a function component to add some local state to it. useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.
- The only argument to useState is the initial state.
